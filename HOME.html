    <h3>
        Examinations are the most important part of a student’s life. The future of a student depends upon how they have performed in the examinations. The Indian Examination system is considered to be one of the best examination systems of the world. It has been revised many times by the government in the past years making it comprehensive. There are various exam boards under this system, CBSE being the most integral one. Our Examination System mainly focuses on evaluating the students by holding up large scale exams annually or quarterly. It is necessary for every student to participate in these exams to pursue and achieve their goals in life. But sometimes, due to the pressure on students for passing up these exams, they start using unfair means. </h3> </p>

      <h3 id="sub">EXAMINATION AND EVALUATION</h3>
      <p>
        <h3>Education has all along been and continues to be an amalgam of teaching and testing enterprises.  In this context, while the central stage has come to be occupied by “teaching”, “testing” often remains relegated to the background as an end of the process ritual.  The purpose of the present effort is not to highlight this shortfall, but to better visualize the meaning and significance of examinations and evaluation, in ethos of the total backdrop.<br><br>By: Lakshay Sharma
            
    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The two terms of evaluation and examination not only deserve to be understood but more so distinguished for being appreciated. While the purpose of the Examination is to identify the level of attainment at a particular point of time, that of the Evaluation is to further improve the level of attainment. With regard to coverage, while the latter tends to mainly focus on the academic and scholastic aspects of personality, the former attempts to bring within its purview the total personality of the student including the co-scholastic aspects. With regard to periodicity, while examination consists of events at fixed points of time, the former assumes the form of a process spread over the total span of the teaching and learning. The status of the individual student in the latter is that of an incognito roll number, while the former treats him as a human being of flesh and blood. The techniques and tools pressed into service by the latter are just a few; the former uses a wide variety of them. It is this that forms the foundation on which the entire edifice of the two concepts stands.</h3><br><br><br>

<h2 id="sub">EVALUATION IN ANCIENT AND IN MODERN TIMES</h2><br>
        
<h3>Our system of judging pupils in ancient times was evaluation, unlike the present one which is examination oriented. Being built into the total teaching-learning process as an integral part, our ancient system of judging student abilities was comprehensive as compared to being segmental, flexible as compared to being rigid, pupil centric as compared to being system centric. Those who used to teach also used to test. Evaluation used to be, thus, based upon its judgements on the basis of the focused observation of the day-to-day progress and behaviour of the students, which was monitored in its varied ramifications. The judgements, though subjective, were most certainly valid and reliable. These no doubt were informal evaluations but surely more authentic than the formal ones, which the British implanted in India.</h3>
        
<br> <img src="ancient.jfif"><img src="ancient.png"> <img src="ancient1.jfif"> <img src= ancient2.jfif><br><br>
        
        
<h3>The teacher was trusted and treated with respect and his assessment was honoured by everybody. The British system of external examinations was imposed and based rather on the mistrust of the teacher; and dubbed our ancient system as subjective. They shackled our valuable approaches with systemic and impersonal controls which robbed us of a time tested cultural heritage of accurate, dependable and just evaluation.
The British implanted examinations, that commenced with the Woods despatch of 1854, were infact the result of a political conspiracy deliberately hatched for undermining the indigenous system of testing by indirectly under-rating it. 
<br>The manipulations were an attempt of stabbing in the back the indigenous system in vogue, in the Pathshalas and the Madarsas, Quite stealthily and cleverly they tried to boost the importance of external collective examination, which in a positive manner, tended to reduce the importance of our indigenous systems. The enticements of formal certification of qualifications as a requirement for jobs and also admission to courses of higher education was done to further enhance the prestige of this examination system.</h3>

<h3>Furthermore, the move of making English as an essential qualification for attaining access to governmental jobs, helped in the popularization of the language of the rulers because of the economic bait. The newly introduced examination system, no doubt, appealed to the common man as a more methodical and systematic one. This also made its acceptance smooth. It was indeed a politicaly motivated decision for linking examination certification for jobs as an economically viable factor.</h3>
   
<h2 id="sub">EXAMINATION AND EVALUATION NOWADAYS</h2><br>
        
<h3 id="sub">Class IX-X</h3>
        
<h3>The pattern of examination changes periodically by the board. The CBSE new pattern marks the following changes in the same. The assessment pattern of Class 10 applies to the Class 9 by the CBSE board. The CBSE new pattern of class 9 examination has been changed to a year end exam. Each subject has a total of 100 marks, where 80 marks is assigned toward written examination and 20 marks as internal assessment. <br><br>The internal assessment marks has three disciplines:-</h3>
        
<h3 id="left">A). 10 marks periodic tests<br>B). 5 marks for notebook submission and<br>C). 5 marks for enrichment activity of all subjects</h3>

<h3 id="sub">Class VI-VIII</h3>
        
<h3>There are no changes in the assessment format for Classes 6 to 8. Yet, the CBSE new patternhas made changes in the number of term exams. Students from classes 6 to 8 have to appear twice in term exams. The board conducts exam at the end of each term. The exam is set based on the syllabus covered during each terms. For term 2 exam, it includes a percentage of questions from term 1 syllabus.<br>
</h3>
        
<h3 id="sub">Class I-V</h3><br> 
        
<h3>As per the latest CBSE exam pattern for class 1 to 5, the assessment of students will be done in two areas i.e.

1. Scholastic

2. Co-scholastic

The scholastic area mostly includes test marks, notebook upkeep and subject enrichment. On the other hand, the co-scholastic areas include skill-based activities, art education, physical educations and other co-curricular activities like dance, art, music, etc. The academic year is split into two sessions i.e. 
        </h3><br>
        
<h3 id="sub">PRE PRIMARY</h3>
        
<h3>In pre-primary education, assessment has two tasks. It is used to plan and develop education and to support the well-being, growth and learning of each child. There are no achievement standards for children in pre-primary education. The teacher follows the development and learning of each child during pre-primary education.  The follow up is based on continuous observations and versatile documentation. Based on the follow-up information and assessment conclusions based on it, the teacher adapts instruction and learning environments, as well as possible support received by children. The teacher and other personnel involved in guiding the children give daily encouraging feedback on the strengths and development areas of the children. Also guardians are provided with regular feedback on their child.</h3>
        
<br><img src=nurse.jpg> <img src=nurse1.jpg> <img src=nurse2.jpg> <img src=nurse3.jpg> 
        
        
<h3>Pre-primary education also promotes children’s capabilities for self-evaluation, which will support the development of their self-concept and learning skills. The teacher may formulate an individual learning plan for each child in cooperation with the child and the guardian.  A child’s pre-primary education plan is a plan for the progress of a child’s growth and learning and for the support needed. It is a pedagogical document based on the curriculum. The education providers are not required to draft individual plans for each child in pre-primary education, but in practice most do. A learning plan is mandatory if the child receives intensified support.

A certificate of attendance may be awarded at the end of pre-primary education. Such a certificate may be supplemented with a description of the pre-primary education provided.</h3>

    <h3>In short, unfair means refers to cheating. It involves any attempt by a student to
gain unfair advantage over another student in the completion of an assessment or exam, or
assist someone else in gaining an unfair advantage.
Consequences
The consequence of unfair means can be serious. A student may face action by his/her academic department or formal disciplinary action. 
Some unfair means used in examination includes Plagiarism, leaking of the exam paper and in extreme cases giving bribe to the invigilator to support cheating.<br><br><br></h3>


<h3 id="left">i)&nbsp; Plagiarism occurs when you submit someone else's work or ideas - eg the work of an expert, lecturer or fellow/former student - without making it clear that it is not your own work. Plagiarism can be committed knowingly or accidentally.<br><br>

ii)&nbsp; The leaking of exam papers directly means the releasing of question papers prior to the exam. To avoid this our Indian Government has declared strict punishment to the guilty. 
The imprisonment will be from five to 10 years and fine from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 10 crore if any case any person impersonates or leak, attempt to leak or conspires to leak question paper, procures or attempts to possess question paper in an unauthorised manner or solves/attempts to solve/seek assistance to solve question.<br><br>

iii) &nbsp; This is a very rare case in India, in which invigilators are given money by the students so that they support cheating during the examination. This is illegal in almost every country across the globe and the guilty are severely punished.</h3><br>
